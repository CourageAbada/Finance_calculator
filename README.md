Investment or Bond Calculator
This Python code allows users to choose between calculating the amount of interest they will earn on an investment or the amount they will have to pay on a home loan. The user is prompted to enter their choice and then is asked to enter the relevant details for their chosen option.

Usage
To use this program, simply run the code in a Python environment.

When prompted, enter either "investment" or "bond" to indicate which calculation you want to make.

If you choose "investment," you will be asked to enter the following information:

The amount of money you plan to invest
The interest rate (as a number, not a percentage)
The number of years you plan to invest for
Whether you want to use simple or compound interest
If you choose "bond," you will be asked to enter the following information:

The value of the house you want to buy
The interest rate (as a percentage)
The number of months you plan to take to pay off the loan
The program will then calculate either the amount of interest you will earn on your investment or the monthly payment you will need to make on your home loan.

Limitations
This program assumes that the interest rate and the length of the investment or loan remain constant over time.

The program does not take into account any fees or charges that may be associated with the investment or loan.

Future Improvements
The program could be expanded to include options for other types of investments or loans.

The program could be improved to allow for varying interest rates and investment/loan lengths over time.
